# MHW_Drivers

Code to support publication: Holbrook et al., Nature Communications, A global assessment of marine heatwaves and their drivers.

## Figure 1 Scripts

Scripts to generate Figure 1 are in the 'Figure_1' folder.

* mhw_census.py generates the mean MHW intensity, duration and frequency data globally, following Oliver et al. (Nat. Comms., 2018) and identical code supporting that paper [here](https://github.com/ecjoliver/Global_MHW_Trends).
* mhw_census_plots_MHWDrivers.py uses the data generated by the previous script, and the coordinates of the region boxes in the 'data/' subfolder, to generate the figure in the manuscript.
