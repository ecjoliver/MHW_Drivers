    Applies the Hobday et al. (2016) marine heat wave definition to an input time
    series of temp ('temp') along with a time vector ('t'). Outputs properties of
    all detected marine heat waves.

    Inputs:

      t       Time vector, in datetime format (e.g., date(1982,1,1).toordinal())
              [1D numpy array of length T]
      temp    Temperature vector [1D numpy array of length T]

    Outputs:

      mhw     Detected marine heat waves (MHWs). Each key (following list) is a
              list of length N where N is the number of detected MHWs:
 
        'time_start'           Start time of MHW [datetime format]
        'time_end'             End time of MHW [datetime format]
        'time_peak'            Time of MHW peak [datetime format]
        'date_start'           Start date of MHW [datetime format]
        'date_end'             End date of MHW [datetime format]
        'date_peak'            Date of MHW peak [datetime format]
        'index_start'          Start index of MHW
        'index_end'            End index of MHW
        'index_peak'           Index of MHW peak
        'duration'             Duration of MHW [days]
        'intensity_max'        Maximum (peak) intensity [deg. C]
        'intensity_mean'       Mean intensity [deg. C]
        'intensity_var'        Intensity variability [deg. C]
        'intensity_cumulative' Cumulative intensity [deg. C x days]
        'rate_onset'           Onset rate of MHW [deg. C / days]
        'rate_decline'         Decline rate of MHW [deg. C / days]

        'intensity_max_relThresh', 'intensity_mean_relThresh', 'intensity_var_relThresh', 
        and 'intensity_cumulative_relThresh' are as above except relative to the
        threshold (e.g., 90th percentile) rather than the seasonal climatology

        'intensity_max_abs', 'intensity_mean_abs', 'intensity_var_abs', and
        'intensity_cumulative_abs' are as above except as absolute magnitudes
        rather than relative to the seasonal climatology or threshold

        'intensity_max_norm' and 'intensity_mean_norm' are as above except units are in
        multiples of threshold exceedances, i.e., a value of 1.5 indicates the MHW
        intensity (relative to the climatology) was 1.5 times the value of the threshold
        (relative to climatology, i.e., threshold - climatology)

        'n_events'             A scalar integer (not a list) indicating the total
                               number of detected MHW events

      clim    Climatology of SST. Each key (following list) is a seasonally-varying
              time series [1D numpy array of length T] of a particular measure:

        'thresh'               Seasonally varying threshold (e.g., 90th percentile)
        'seas'                 Climatological seasonal cycle
        'missing'              A vector of TRUE/FALSE indicating which elements in 
                               temp were missing values for the MHWs detection

    Options:

      climatologyPeriod      Period over which climatology is calculated, specified
                             as list of start and end years (DEFAULT = [1983,2012])
      pctile                 Threshold percentile (%) for detection of extreme values
                             (DEFAULT = 90)
      windowHalfWidth        Width of window (one sided) about day-of-year used for
                             the pooling of values and calculation of threshold percentile
                             (DEFAULT = 5 [days])
      smoothPercentile       Boolean switch indicating whether to smooth the threshold
                             percentile timeseries with a moving average (DEFAULT = True)
      smoothPercentileWidth  Width of moving average window for smoothing threshold
                             (DEFAULT = 31 [days])
      minDuration            Minimum duration for acceptance detected MHWs
                             (DEFAULT = 5 [days])
      joinAcrossGaps         Boolean switch indicating whether to join MHWs
                             which occur before/after a short gap (DEFAULT = True)
      maxGap                 Maximum length of gap allowed for the joining of MHWs
                             (DEFAULT = 2 [days])
      maxPadLength           Specifies the maximum length [days] over which to interpolate
                             (pad) missing data (specified as nans) in input temp time series.
                             i.e., any consecutive blocks of NaNs with length greater
                             than maxPadLength will be left as NaN. Set as an integer.
                             (DEFAULT = False, interpolates over all missing values).
      coldSpells             Specifies if the code should detect cold events instead of
                             heat events. (DEFAULT = False)
      alternateClimatology   Specifies an alternate temperature time series to use for the
                             calculation of the climatology. Format is as a list of numpy
                             arrays: (1) the first element of the list is a time vector,
                             in datetime format (e.g., date(1982,1,1).toordinal())
                             [1D numpy array of length TClim] and (2) the second element of
                             the list is a temperature vector [1D numpy array of length TClim].
                             (DEFAULT = False)

    Notes:

      1. This function assumes that the input time series consist of continuous daily values
         with few missing values. Time ranges which start and end part-way through the calendar
         year are supported.

      2. This function supports leap years. This is done by ignoring Feb 29s for the initial
         calculation of the climatology and threshold. The value of these for Feb 29 is then
         linearly interpolated from the values for Feb 28 and Mar 1.

      3. The calculation of onset and decline rates assumes that the heat wave started a half-day
         before the start day and ended a half-day after the end-day. (This is consistent with the
         duration definition as implemented, which assumes duration = end day - start day + 1.)

      4. For the purposes of MHW detection, any missing temp values not interpolated over (through
         optional maxPadLLength) will be set equal to the seasonal climatology. This means they will
         trigger the end/start of any adjacent temp values which satisfy the MHW criteria.

      5. If the code is used to detect cold events (coldSpells = True), then it works just as for heat
         waves except that events are detected as deviations below the (100 - pctile)th percentile
         (e.g., the 10th instead of 90th) for at least 5 days. Intensities are reported as negative
         values and represent the temperature anomaly below climatology.

    '''

    Calculate statistics of marine heatwave (MHW) properties averaged over blocks of
    a specified length of time. Takes as input a collection of detected MHWs
    (using the marineHeatWaves.detect function) and a time vector for the source
    SST series.

    Inputs:

      t       Time vector, in datetime format (e.g., date(1982,1,1).toordinal())
      mhw     Marine heat waves (MHWs) detected using marineHeatWaves.detect

    Outputs:

      mhwBlock   Time series of block-averaged MHW properties. Each key (following list)
                 is a list of length N where N is the number of blocks:
 
        'years_start'          Start year blocks (inclusive)
        'years_end'            End year of blocks (inclusive)
        'years_centre'         Decimal year at centre of blocks
        'count'                Total MHW count in each block
        'duration'             Average MHW duration in each block [days]
        'intensity_max'        Average MHW "maximum (peak) intensity" in each block [deg. C]
        'intensity_max_max'    Maximum MHW "maximum (peak) intensity" in each block [deg. C]
        'intensity_mean'       Average MHW "mean intensity" in each block [deg. C]
        'intensity_var'        Average MHW "intensity variability" in each block [deg. C]
        'intensity_cumulative' Average MHW "cumulative intensity" in each block [deg. C x days]
        'rate_onset'           Average MHW onset rate in each block [deg. C / days]
        'rate_decline'         Average MHW decline rate in each block [deg. C / days]
        'total_days'           Total number of MHW days in each block [days]
        'total_icum'           Total cumulative intensity over all MHWs in each block [deg. C x days]

        'intensity_max_relThresh', 'intensity_mean_relThresh', 'intensity_var_relThresh', 
        and 'intensity_cumulative_relThresh' are as above except relative to the
        threshold (e.g., 90th percentile) rather than the seasonal climatology

        'intensity_max_abs', 'intensity_mean_abs', 'intensity_var_abs', and
        'intensity_cumulative_abs' are as above except as absolute magnitudes
        rather than relative to the seasonal climatology or threshold

        'intensity_max_norm' and 'intensity_mean_norm' are as above except units are in
        multiples of threshold exceedances, i.e., a value of 1.5 indicates the MHW
        intensity (relative to the climatology) was 1.5 times the value of the threshold
        (relative to climatology, i.e., threshold - climatology)

    Options:

      blockLength            Size of block (in years) over which to calculate the
                             averaged MHW properties. Must be an integer greater than
                             or equal to 1 (DEFAULT = 1 [year])
      removeMissing          Boolean switch indicating whether to remove (set = NaN)
                             statistics for any blocks in which there were missing 
                             temperature values (DEFAULT = FALSE)
      clim                   The temperature climatology (including missing value information)
                             as output by marineHeatWaves.detect (required if removeMissing = TRUE)
      temp                   Temperature time series. If included mhwBlock will output block
                             averages of mean, max, and min temperature (DEFAULT = NONE)

    Notes:

      This function assumes that the input time vector consists of continuous daily values. Note that
      in the case of time ranges which start and end part-way through the calendar year, the block
      averages at the endpoints, for which there is less than a block length of data, will need to be
      interpreted with care.

      trend         Linear trend of all MHW properties over all block-averaged values
      dtrend        One-sided width of (1-alpha)% confidence intevfal on linear trend,

        'rate_onset'           Onset rate of MHW [deg. C / days]
        'rate_decline'         Decline rate of MHW [deg. C / days]

        'intensity_max_relThresh', 'intensity_mean_relThresh', 'intensity_var_relThresh', 
        and 'intensity_cumulative_relThresh' are as above except relative to the

        'intensity_cumulative_abs' are as above except as absolute magnitudes
        rather than relative to the seasonal climatology or threshold

        'intensity_max_norm' and 'intensity_mean_norm' are as above except units are in
        multiples of threshold exceedances, i.e., a value of 1.5 indicates the MHW
        intensity (relative to the climatology) was 1.5 times the value of the threshold
        (relative to climatology, i.e., threshold - climatology)
 
    Notes:

      This calculation performs a multiple linear regression of the form
        y ~ beta * X + eps
      where y is the MHW property of interest and X is a matrix of predictors. The first
      column of X is all ones to estimate the mean, the second column is the time vector
      which is taken as mhwBlock['years_centre'] and offset to be equal to zero at its
      mid-point.

                    an event at least as large/long as the event in quetion. Each key (listed
                    below) is a list of length N where N is the number of MHWs.
 
        'duration'             Average MHW duration in each block [days]
        'intensity_max'        Average MHW "maximum (peak) intensity" in each block [deg. C]
        'intensity_mean'       Average MHW "mean intensity" in each block [deg. C]
        'intensity_var'        Average MHW "intensity variability" in each block [deg. C]
        'intensity_cumulative' Average MHW "cumulative intensity" in each block [deg. C x days]
        'rate_onset'           Average MHW onset rate in each block [deg. C / days]
        'rate_decline'         Average MHW decline rate in each block [deg. C / days]
        'total_days'           Total number of MHW days in each block [days]
        'total_icum'           Total cumulative intensity over all MHWs in each block [deg. C x days]

        'intensity_max_relThresh', 'intensity_mean_relThresh', 'intensity_var_relThresh', 
        and 'intensity_cumulative_relThresh' are as above except relative to the
        threshold (e.g., 90th percentile) rather than the seasonal climatology

        'intensity_max_abs', 'intensity_mean_abs', 'intensity_var_abs', and
        'intensity_cumulative_abs' are as above except as absolute magnitudes
        rather than relative to the seasonal climatology or threshold

        'intensity_max_norm' and 'intensity_mean_norm' are as above except units are in
        multiples of threshold exceedances, i.e., a value of 1.5 indicates the MHW
        intensity (relative to the climatology) was 1.5 times the value of the threshold
        (relative to climatology, i.e., threshold - climatology)

    Notes:

      This function assumes that the MHWs were calculated over a suitably long record that return
      periods make sense. If the record length is a few years or less than this becomes meaningless.
